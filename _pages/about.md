# Hi there! 👋

I am a Machine Learning Engineer in the **Platform Architecture** organization at [ Apple](https://www.apple.com/). I was a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Prof. Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/saibal-mukhopadhyay) as part of the [GREEN Lab](https://greenlab.ece.gatech.edu/).

Before that, I studied **Microelectronics and VLSI Design** through a **Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech)** at the Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). During my undergraduate studies, I worked closely with [Prof. Debdeep Mukhopadhyay](https://sites.google.com/view/debdeepmukhopadhyay/home) at the [SEAL Lab](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/resgrp/seal/), where I completed both my Bachelor’s and Master’s theses, focusing on hardware and system security.

Throughout my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to intern and collaborate with leading industry and research organizations, including [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) (Fujita Lab), [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/), [Pix Moving](https://www.pixmoving.com/), [Intel](https://www.intel.com/), and [AMD](https://www.amd.com/).

## Research & Technical Focus

I am a system researcher with breadth spanning **ML algorithms** (applied mathematics), **AI frameworks** (model optimization toolkits), and **embedded systems**, along with deep proficiency in **HW/SW co-design**, **hardware accelerators**, and **computer architecture**. 

My PhD research delves into **ML-HW co-design for sensor processing pipelines**. I have experience with multiple **tapeouts** covering the full spectrum from algorithm to architecture, design, chip bring-up, and testing. In addition, I have also worked on **security research** during my Bachelor's and Master's theses.



## Current Research Interests
- Hardware Accelerators (HW/SW Co-design)
- Efficient AI
